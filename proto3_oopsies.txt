- Add breakaway tab on top so top and bottom can be V-scored
- Make sure text faces same direction
- Speaker hole overlaps text
- 2V5 footprint too small (depends on osc? Perhaps add a tiny bit of length to footprint so fat one fits as

- buttons are horrible :/

- Hole under D-pad?
- R57 (ref adc) 100r -> 1K
- ADC GPIOs should connect to 'normal' GPIOs as well
- LEDs should connect to 'proper' colors
- Pullup on one of the common led drivers (R69)
