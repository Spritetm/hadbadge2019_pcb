# Hackaday Supercon 2019 Badge: PCB/schematics

This repo contains the schematics and PCB artwork for the Hackaday Supercon 2019 badge. It isn't
as cleaned up yet as I want to be, but I hope it works as a reference. Note that there may be some
older text and other files floating around in the repo as well.

License: TBD. Feel free to use this as a reference for now, I need to have a think about which
license I will release it under. For now, contact me if you want to do something with this and
we'll work something out.
